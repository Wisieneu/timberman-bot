# Timberman-bot

A Timberman bot that is mostly basing on the openCV-python directory as a detection engine. This is my very first public Python project that is a part of my professional portfolio.
It's a very easy to use, interactive Command-line interface that uses user input for navigation. 
It is most recommended that you use the [Steam version of the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/398710/Timberman/) as the primary version of this program has been made for this client using its assets.

## How do I run it????
Run **timberman_scripy.py** on any IDE. 
though before doing so, make sure you have python installed and all libraries listed in `requirements.txt` on your PC as well.

## Settings
Use singleplayer
Game resolution: 1920x1080 windowed/borderless
Any position on screen, program will alt tab to the game automatically for you
Bot works best on a cookie map and that metal-futuristic one as the branch assets are most consistent there. On these maps the bot scores over 5000 for me very easily. 

## Contribution 
Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. I understand that I might have overlooked some stuff - OS specific and any other issues you might encounter are very welcome to sumbit.
To develop, you will need Python and all the directories listed in requirements.txt
